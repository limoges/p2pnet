Interim Report 

1. Architecture
-------------------

1.1 What type of process architecture you have?
-----------------------------------------------

The modules are each running their own process. That "module process" follows a
common architecture which is as follow. The main thread of the module is launched
and is responsible for active decisions, such as, looking for bootstrapping peers,
exploring the network for new peers, etc...

Depending on the needs of the module, two other threads are launched. One thread
listens to API requests, the other listens to peer requests. These threads listen
for a new connexion and then immediately offload the handling of the connexion
to a working thread which often will handled a chain of actions (handshaking,
responding to a request, etc...).

1.2 Do you use event loops or not?
----------------------------------

There is no event loop per say. The listening threads are passive and listen to
new connexions, while the main thread would run at startup or on a timer.

2. Document the inter-module protocol

2.1 Explain the message formats in the protocol


2.2 How do your modules running on different peers authenticate?
2.3 How does your protocol handle exceptions?
